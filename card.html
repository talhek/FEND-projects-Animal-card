                                The Golden Retriever is a large-sized breed of dog bred as gun dogs to retrieve shot waterfowl 
                                such as ducks and upland game birds during hunting and shooting parties, and were named 'retriever' 
                                because of their ability to retrieve shot game undamaged. Golden Retrievers have an instinctive love of water,
                                and are easy to train to basic or advanced obedience standards. They are cute.
